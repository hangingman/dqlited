A tool for running dqlite

Adapted from [dqlite-demo](https://github.com/canonical/go-dqlite/tree/master/cmd/dqlite-demo)

This provides a means of both running a cluster of servers, as well as running queries against them.

It provides a web api similar to [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite), to provide an initial pass at supporting python ORMs.
